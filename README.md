# 3D Tic-tac-toe Game with Artificial Intelligence
A project for Boston University CS440 Artificial Intelligence.

In this project, I implemented and designed a 4x4x4 Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Java using minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to play intelligently and compete against computer and other players.
